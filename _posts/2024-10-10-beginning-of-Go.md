# My introduction to Go

I heard the name Go back in 2017. But I never had the oppertunity to learn it.
I already make web applications with Java and Spring Boot, and even Python at times, so I didn't see the need to learn another language.
But I had some free time today and I decided to give it a try after watching a video about Programming languages as seven deadly sins.
Honestly it was kinda funny.
It mentioned rust and made a joke about how go could be better.
I had already learned rust and I liked it, but making web applications with it was a bit difficult.
So I decided to give Go a try.
I thought it might not be as good as rust in terms of performance, but it might be easier to make web applications with it.
I was right.
I made a simple web application with Go and it was really easy.
It's as if you combine the simplicity of Python with the performance of rust.
I think I'm gonna invest more time in learning Go.
I might even make a web application with it for my next project.
A plan that I already have in mind is to make myself a cool website with Go.
Something like a blog or a portfolio. I think it would be a good project to learn Go with.
I want the website to be advanced yet simple so that I can show off my skills while keeping it easy to maintain.
I'll have to think about it more.
