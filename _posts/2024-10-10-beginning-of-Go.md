# My Introduction to Go

I first heard about Go back in **2017**, but I never had the opportunity to learn it. I was already developing web applications with **Java** and **Spring Boot**, and sometimes with **Python**, so I didn't see the need to learn another language.

However, I had some free time today and decided to give Go a try after watching a video about programming languages as the seven deadly sins. The video was quite funny and mentioned **Rust**, making a joke about how Go could be better. I had already learned Rust and liked it, but found making web applications with it a bit challenging. So, I decided to give Go a try.

I thought Go might not match Rust in terms of performance, but it could be easier for web development. I was right. I made a simple web application with Go, and it was really easy. It's like combining the simplicity of Python with the performance of Rust.

### Key Points:

- **Ease of Learning**: Go is straightforward and easy to pick up.
- **Web Development**: Creating web applications with Go is simple and efficient.
- **Performance**: While not as performant as Rust, Go offers a good balance between simplicity and speed.

I think I'm going to invest more time in learning Go. I might even use it for my next project. One idea I have is to create a cool website with Go, perhaps a blog or a portfolio. It would be a good project to learn Go with. I want the website to be advanced yet simple, showcasing my skills while being easy to maintain. I'll have to think about it more.

### Future Plans:

- **Learn More Go**: Dedicate more time to mastering Go.
- **Next Project**: Consider building a blog or portfolio website with Go.
- **Project Goals**: 
    - Advanced yet simple design
    - Showcase skills
    - Easy to maintain

I'll have to think about it more.
